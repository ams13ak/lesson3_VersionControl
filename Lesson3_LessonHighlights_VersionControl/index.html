            <p class="lead"> Version control is a very usefully tool for a company or web design firm working on important documents or documents at the same time!  Version control is one main repository for all of the project files. A version repository can be local either remotely or a person local machine.  Team members check files out, male changes, then check them back in ( or commit them). This tool will solve the file sharing problem. It gives companies and project managers the control to see who made the mistake and where the mistake took place at the same time nothing is lost or permeant changed.

            <p class="lead">Version control system will automatically note an employee changes to a file. It will note who changed the files (revision history), when they changed the file, what about the files is new or different, and will merge changes to the same file.  Version control system benefits are files cannot be overwritten. There is a common repository that holds all the latest files. Allows you to revert back to an older version of the file/project if needed. Even if you don’t work with a team, version control system will backup files so that you won’t lose your work or have to start a project over. (104)<p>

            <p class="lead">Web designer and developers like to use version control systems for all the top benefits and perks the system offers. When a repository is created with files and directories, developers can record their change history and start tracking their status and version.  Web designer and developers like the remote repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members. Version control system also use local repository that reside on a local machine on an individual user. Two ways to create local repository is to create a brand new repository or clone an existing remote repository onto your local machine.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Some basic commands of Git are git init, git add –all, git commit, git log, git status, and git remote. Some important reasons to use git are every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine. Everything is local, so you can work online and there is no single point of failure, process run much faster. It will prevent an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. This programs works for any size company.

            <p class="lead">You can get a Git project using two main approaches. The first takes an existing project or directory and imports it into Git. The second clones an existing Git repository from another server. Another basic git is recording changes to the repository. There is two states that a file can be in a working directory tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are everything else – any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. All of these basic feature are extremely help when using Git.
